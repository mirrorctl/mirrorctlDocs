`mirrorctl` is a good-faith fork of the `go-apt-mirror` portion of
[cybozu-go/aptutil](https://github.com/cybozu-go/aptutil).
That project was / is in maintenance mode,
and I liked it, but knew that it needed some work. So, I picked it up.

I'm a Senior Linux Engineer living and working in Chicago, Illinois.

Please feel free to say hello and let me know if you have any questions or issues with the
application. For now, submitting a GitHub issue would be fine.
