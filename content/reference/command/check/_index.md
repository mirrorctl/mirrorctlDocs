The `mirrorctl check` command doesn't do anything by itself. It requires usage of subcommands.

Supported `mirrorctl check` subcommands are:

- [config]({{< relref "config" >}}) - Validate configuration file
- [tls]({{< relref "tls" >}}) - Check TLS configuration and certificate

See each subcommand's reference page for further information.
