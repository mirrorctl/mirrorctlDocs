Congratulations! You've completed the mirrorctl tutorial and learned how to create, secure, and manage Debian repository mirrors. This page provides guidance on where to go next.

## What You've Learned

Through this tutorial, you've covered:

- Creating and configuring repository mirrors
- Working with snapshots for versioning and rollback
- Implementing a staging-to-production workflow
- Expanding mirrors across architectures, suites, and sections
- Securing mirrors with PGP and TLS verification
- Performing common maintenance operations
- Troubleshooting issues and monitoring mirror health

## Advanced Topics

Ready to go deeper? Explore these advanced topics:

### High Availability Mirrors

Set up redundant mirror infrastructure:

- Configure multiple mirror servers with load balancing
- Use rsync or snapshot replication between mirror servers
- Implement health checks and automatic failover
- Serve mirrors via CDN for global distribution

### Custom Snapshot Workflows

Develop sophisticated snapshot strategies:

- Create named snapshots for releases (e.g., "2025-q1-release")
- Maintain long-term retention snapshots for compliance
- Implement automated testing before promotion
- Use snapshots for multiple staging environments (dev, qa, prod)

### Package Filtering

Fine-tune what gets mirrored:

- Use `exclude_patterns` to filter out unwanted packages
- Implement `keep_versions` policies for space optimization
- Create specialized mirrors for specific use cases
- Combine filters with partial architecture mirroring

### Web Server Configuration

Optimize mirror serving:

- Configure Nginx or Apache to serve mirrors efficiently
- Enable HTTP/2 for better performance
- Implement caching headers for client efficiency
- Set up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for secure access
- Configure directory listings and index files

### Integration with Configuration Management

Automate mirror deployment:

- Deploy mirrorctl with Ansible, Puppet, or Chef
- Template configuration files for different environments
- Automate PGP key distribution and updates
- Manage mirror infrastructure as code

## Production Deployment Considerations

Before deploying to production, consider:

### Infrastructure Planning

- **Disk space**: Plan for 2-3x repository size for snapshots and growth
- **Network bandwidth**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth for syncs and client access
- **Server resources**: Allocate appropriate CPU/RAM for sync operations
- **Backup strategy**: Backup configuration files and critical snapshots

### Security Hardening

- **File permissions**: Restrict mirror directory permissions appropriately
- **Firewall rules**: Limit inbound access to HTTP/HTTPS ports only
- **SELinux/AppArmor**: Configure mandatory access controls if applicable
- **Update policies**: Establish procedures for updating mirrorctl and keys

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Sync success monitoring**: Alert on failed syncs
- **Disk space alerts**: Warning before space runs out
- **Performance monitoring**: Track sync duration and bandwidth
- **Security alerts**: Monitor for verification failures

### Documentation

Document your mirror infrastructure:

- Configuration rationale and decisions
- Sync schedules and maintenance windows
- Rollback procedures and contact information
- Disaster recovery plans

## Common Use Cases

### Corporate Internal Mirror

Organizations often maintain internal mirrors for:

- Reduced external bandwidth usage
- Faster package installation across the fleet
- Consistent package versions across environments
- Offline or air-gapped infrastructure support

**Key features to use:**
- Staging workflow for tested updates
- Snapshot retention for rollback
- PGP and TLS verification for security
- Scheduled syncs during maintenance windows

### Development Mirror

Development teams use mirrors for:

- Reproducible build environments
- Pinned package versions
- Custom package repositories
- Testing new packages before deployment

**Key features to use:**
- Named snapshots for releases
- Package filtering to reduce size
- Multiple mirrors (stable, testing, experimental)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Edge Location Mirror

Edge deployments benefit from local mirrors:

- Low-latency package access
- Reduced WAN traffic
- Continued operation during network outages
- Support for bandwidth-constrained locations

**Key features to use:**
- Minimal architecture/section mirroring
- Periodic sync from central mirror
- Snapshot replication for consistency
- Automated health monitoring

## Example Production Configurations

### Complete Production Setup

Here's a full production configuration example:

```toml
# /etc/mirrorctl/mirror.toml
# Production mirror configuration

# Base directory for all mirrors
dir = "/var/www/apt/"

# Global TLS security settings
[tls]
min_version = "1.2"
insecure_skip_verify = false

# Snapshot configuration
[snapshot]
path = "/var/lib/mirrorctl/snapshots"
default_name_format = "2006-01-02T15-04-05Z"

[snapshot.prune]
keep_last = 10
keep_within = "60d"

# Logging
[log]
level = "info"
format = "json"

# Ubuntu main repository
[mirrors.ubuntu]
url = "https://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"
suites = ["noble", "jammy", "focal"]
sections = ["main", "universe", "restricted", "multiverse"]
architectures = ["amd64", "arm64"]
pgp_key_path = "/etc/mirrorctl/keys/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg"
publish_to_staging = true

# Ubuntu security repository
[mirrors.ubuntu-security]
url = "https://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"
suites = ["noble-security", "jammy-security", "focal-security"]
sections = ["main", "universe", "restricted", "multiverse"]
architectures = ["amd64", "arm64"]
pgp_key_path = "/etc/mirrorctl/keys/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg"
publish_to_staging = true

# Ubuntu updates repository
[mirrors.ubuntu-updates]
url = "https://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"
suites = ["noble-updates", "jammy-updates", "focal-updates"]
sections = ["main", "universe", "restricted", "multiverse"]
architectures = ["amd64", "arm64"]
pgp_key_path = "/etc/mirrorctl/keys/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg"
